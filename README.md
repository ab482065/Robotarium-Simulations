# Robotarium-Simulations
This repository includes a number of consensus-based control examples (Leader/Follower-Formation Control) developed using Robotarium on Matlab.
The main example is two_leader_follower_union.m \
In order to run the simulations, install the Robotarium Library from https://github.com/robotarium/robotarium-matlab-simulator \
The examples leader_follower_triangular_formation.m and hexagon_formation.m have been sent to Robotarium and tested on the real robots. For more info on experiments see: https://www.robotarium.gatech.edu/get_started \
